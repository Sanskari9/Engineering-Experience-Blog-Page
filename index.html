          Choosing Engineering College isn't easy. All over the India there is
          thousand of Engineering college. Mostly Students dream is to get
          admission in IIT, NIT,etc. But My Dream was to get the admission in MITS
          Gwalior. And Luckly I got the college.

          Hi, My name is Santosh Kushwah.Currently, I'm pursuing B.tech in
          Electrical Engineering from MITS Gwalior.And I am the First Engineer in
          my Family. Here I want to share all my learning throughout the degree.I
          share my experiences from 1st year to till now and all the thing that i
          was exploring in my past.

            <h4 class="upperCase">First Year | The Journey begins</h4>
            <p>
              The first year was the year where the engineering journey begins.
              The first year was all about induction program, new
              environment,first midsem fear,Endsem exam tension,meet new people
              and much more,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was the first bencher in my first year.And I was also caring about
              my classes, assignment,exams, notes. And from the first year, I met
              my friend and these peoples are wonderful. I learned from the first
              year that Mostly students don't focus to exploring the things they
              was only touched with the academics I was one of them. I think
              Students should have take participate in the event that organised by
              the different clubs of the colleges.The clubs will helps to make
              connections , interactions with new peoples, And In the clubs you
              worked with the team where you learn team work. Although Engineering
              Labs also work same.
            </p>
            <p>
              And from the mid of the 2nd Sem, The Corona virus was come. And the
              lockdown was happend. And We got the General promotion by the Govt.

            <h4 class="upperCase">Second Year | The Online Joy</h4>
            <p>
              My Second Year was all about Online.The things was included like
              Whatsapp grp, online classes, online assignment, online attendance
              and online exams,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second year was all about exploring the new things.Improve your
              skills and do experiments what you like to do, and much more. In my
              Second year i was doing mobile photography,sketching and learn new
              things. And I join Gym also inspired by the backbenchers where i
              learn descipline, pushing your potential every week and
              confidence,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think In the Second Year, Students should explorer the new skills,
              learn and try to learning new skills where you find your potential
              and much more.

            <h4 class="upperCase">Third Year | The Best Part of Engineering</h4>
            <p>
              My Third Year was all about the Implemention what i learned till
              that time.In third year, you definitely find what you want to do in
              life and Focus on the one that thing you want to do,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              And from the third year, I focusing on coding bcoz i want to go IT
              sector. And I took advice from my friend bcoz he already doing work
              in the IT sector, then I started learn java from youtube And learn
              WebD. And from feb 2022 My third year was started offline. We took
              classes and labs offline and online both.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think In the Third year, Students should focus on one thing that
              you want to do and ignore all the voice from the outside bcoz you
              know what you do in that field.
            </p>

            <h4 class="upperCase">Final Year | The Emotions</h4>
            <p>
              The final year is all emotions where reality hits you and all the
              illusion of mind destroying one by one. The final year starts with
              the placement season.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone starts preparing the company and the first company was
              coming our campus is Accenture. My Experience of Accenture was not
              so good. I am going to the Interview but I am rejected. I learn from
              the accenture is you want to do more practice for the interview and
              exam. I didn't practice for the interview that why i rejected. And
              This was my First Interview.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think Final year give you brief about life where you fail and then
              you learn from that failure and Improve yourself , work on
              yourself,etc.

        Engineering the best experience of my life. Engineering gives me
        Exposure, friends, open mindset, overall development of my thinking and
        much more. Engineering makes a person better human beings that makes
        some changes in the society by their inovation for the society.
